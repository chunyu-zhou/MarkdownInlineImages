# MarkdownInlineImages

MarkdownInlineImages is a plugin that renders your images below their link. Why? Because markdown
is just great, except for images. Reading a markdown file is really easy, almost as easy as a it can
be once it's converted to HTML for example, if you have a good color scheme. Except for images. This
plugin just completes this gap :smile:

So, to use it, just press <kbd>alt+i</kbd>, or, from the command palette, select
`MarkdownInlineImages: Render Images`. All the images will rendered.

You can use images loaded from internet, or relative to your *file*.
